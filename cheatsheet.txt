########### movement around the page ######
# technique 1
High --> H to the top of the page
Middle --> M to the middle of the page
Low --> L to the bottom of the page 

how are these useful ??? say you want to go the a particular line , go to the closest line
H M or L will do it and then use j or k

#technique 2
cntrl + u  --> scroll up ( normally dictaed by size of buffer?? right now moves up 20 lines)
cntrl + d  --> scroll down

#technique 3
23G  --> will take you to line 23 ( all the commands above done need to be pasted using :)

#technique 4
search for the word and go to that approximate line and then use jk
/word  enter ,  cursor will jump to the line

######### Movement within a line ################
# technique 1
w --> puts the cursor below the first character of the next word
b --> backwards movement , puts the cursor below the first char of the prev word
e --> put the cursor below the last character of the prsent word or the last char of next word

#technique 2
Now you are in the line and want to jump to a specific word  eg Awesome?
fA and enter , this will take u to the first A in that line and in this case we assume Awesome is the only word that starts with A
; for next  A and then again press ; for next A 

FA is backwards and for repitition its , and not ; for the previous A

THE ABOVE WILL PUT THE CURSOR RIGHT BELOW THE CHARACTER

TO HAVE THE CURSOR ONE SPACE AHEAD OF THE CHARACTER USE THE FOLLOWING

tA will place it just before A and then ; for next next
TA will place it before the previous word and then , for previous

#technique to delete
dd --> deletes a line but its in command mode
cc --> deletes the line but puts it in insert mode

>>  --> indent the line 
== ---> go back to original

however from the above it should be noted is the motion is just the first character
ie , d c > =
these can be used with other combinations eg delete a word --> dw ( w is from moving within a line)

#combinations
dw --> delete a word and stay in command mode
cw --> delete a word and go into insert mode

#combinations with f and t 
the quick brown fox, jumped over the wall !

#delete till ,  ---> dt,  remained will be --> , jumped over the wall !
#delete everything --> df!  or dd 

### ct, will put in insert move

## combinations with other motions
e --> takes you to the last character of the next word
de --> delete the word ie from the current cursor position to the last character of the next word
2e --> last char of the second word
d2e --> delete upto the last character of the second word
d/searchword  --> delete upto the firt occurrence of the searchword

## how about j and k
j --> next line
dj --> delete current line and the next line
k --> previous line 
dk --> delete current line and also upto the begining of the previous line
